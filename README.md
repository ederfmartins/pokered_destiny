# Pok√©mon Red: Hard Destiny

This is a ROM Hack based on Pokemon FireRed. It uses [pokefirered](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered) as base and add some elements present in the anime to the game, while trying to keep its original look.

Some of the features that you can find in this game includes:
* About 230 Pokemons can be caught, including all 151 gen 1 pokemons. Look at pokemons_and_wild_enconters.md to know all moves each POKEMON can learn, as well as, the location where it apears.
* 6 pokemons to start with.
* TM are not spend when given to a Pokemon, but you can use only one TM or HM on each pokemon.
* Half split between physical and special moves. Some types get access to both move kinds when it makes sense.
* Fixing bug and psychic's power level. Some bug moves get stronger, while some Pokemons with a good coverage aggainst psychic were added.
* Some balance in the number of Pokemons of each type. Most of the types have between 12 and 20 Pokemons now.
* Balancing the power level of some moves.
* Battle aggainst an unofitial gym (AJ, kaz, yas)
* 15 gyms, one for each type, to explain why Gary was able to get 10 badges in the anime. The new gyms are hidden in the traditional Kanto map, you should try to find them.
* Improved trainers strategies.
* Starters allways have neutral natures.
* Starters allways have good ivs.
* Badges don't grant 10% status increases.
* Each badge only increase in 5 levels the maximum level to a Pokemon to obey your orders.

Coming...
 * Rockets will steal your Pokemons when they defeated some of them.
 * A real Pokemon leage after defeating elite 4.
 * Important battles will enforce the set mode, making then more interesting.

At this moment, this hack is already playable.

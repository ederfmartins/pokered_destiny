# Pok√©mon Red: Destiny

This is a ROM Hack based on Pokemon FireRed. It uses [pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered) as base and add some elements present in the anime to the game, while trying to keep its original look.

Some of the features that you can find in this game includes:
* An history on how Gary was able to get 10 badges. You should try to surpace him.
* The opportunity to battle aggaist iconic characters of the anime in a competitive way.
* The secret league.

At this moment, this hack is a work in progress. It is not ready to be played yet.
